# old-musiqtools

This is another old project I created around August 2022, while learning React. This is the second iteration of this idea, improving upon the first by implementing React, componetizing the structure of the project, and integrating better styles. The **old** version's GitHub repository can be found [here](github.com/JoshSilveous/old-fretboard-visualizer), and you can access the deployment [here](https://old-fretboard-visualizer.vercel.app/).

**I have abandoned this project.**

My structure used in the project became unmanageable. I was learning new concepts as I created this, and often times found myself refactoring/rewriting code. This is to be expected when working on a project while learning the library/languages involved.

I ended up restarting again, equipped with more React experience, and created my third (and best) iteration of this idea, underwhelmingly titled **Guitar Visualizer**.
The GitHub Repo for this can be found [here](https://github.com/JoshSilveous/guitar-visualizer), and you can access the tool via [this deployment](https://guitar-visualizer.vercel.app/).

Again, there is a lot of redundant and unneccessary code here- so don't judge me :)
